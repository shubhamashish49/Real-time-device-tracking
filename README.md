Real-Time Device Tracking System
Overview
The Real-Time Device Tracking System provides dynamic visualization of device locations on a map, enabling accurate and responsive monitoring. This system was built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet, with a focus on real-time updates and efficient communication between devices.

Features
Dynamic Map Rendering: Displays real-time device locations using Leaflet.
Real-Time Updates: Leverages WebSockets via Socket.io for instant data synchronization.
Customizable UI: Intuitive and responsive user interface.
Scalable Backend: Built on Node.js and Express for robust performance.
Technologies Used
Frontend: Leaflet.js (for interactive maps), HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Real-Time Communication: Socket.io
Map Data: OpenStreetMap
How It Works
Backend Server:
The server handles client connections, processes location updates, and broadcasts them in real time.
Client Interface:
The client receives location updates and renders them on an interactive map.
Real-Time Data Exchange:
Devices send location data to the server, which distributes updates to all connected clients.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your system.
#Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-device-tracking.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd realtime-device-tracking
Install Dependencies:
npm install
Start the Server:
node server.js
Access the Application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Usage
Device Integration:
Connect your device to the system to start sending location data.
Map Interaction:
View real-time location updates on the interactive map.
Click on markers for additional device information.

Example
Device locations are shown as markers on the map.
New devices appear in real-time, and their positions update dynamically.
Future Enhancements
Support for geofencing and location-based alerts.
Integration with databases to store historical location data.
Enhanced UI features, such as clustering for multiple devices.
